      <h2>Client Background</h2>
      <p>
        A rapidly growing telehealth startup that connects patients with health professionals across regions. They wanted to scale to thousands of consultations per day while integrating AI-driven assistance and automating triage tasks using real-time video conferencing.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        To build a scalable and interactive video conferencing platform that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connects users to live agents (health professionals)</li>
        <li>Integrates AI for pre-consultation triage and live transcription</li>
        <li>Handles 5000+ concurrent sessions and 450,000 sessions per day</li>
        <li>Supports dynamic agent routing, session recording, and metrics tracking</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Video Conferencing:</strong> LiveKit (self-hosted)</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React.js + TailwindCSS</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js + Express</li>
        <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> OpenAI / Vertex AI for NLP & Triage</li>
        <li><strong>Voice-to-Text:</strong> Whisper (OpenAI) or Deepgram</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Auth0 / Firebase Auth</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Grafana + Prometheus + Loki</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Kubernetes (EKS), Redis, PostgreSQL</li>
        <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions + ArgoCD</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
      
      <h3>1. User Onboarding & Agent Matching</h3>
      <p>
        Users initiate a request via the frontend application. The backend triggers matchmaking to assign the right agent based on availability, specialization, and load.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2. AI-Powered Pre-Session</h3>
      <p>
        Before connecting to an agent, an AI triage bot gathers initial information. The AI summarizes symptoms or queries, which are then passed to the agent for context.
      </p>
      
      <h3>3. LiveKit Room Initialization</h3>
      <p>
        A new LiveKit room is created dynamically. Both agent and user join via unique tokens. Optionally, an AI assistant joins silently to transcribe and summarize in real-time.
      </p>
      
      <h3>4. Session Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time transcription and summarization</li>
        <li>Recording & compliance logging</li>
        <li>On-screen tools for drawing, file sharing, and chat</li>
        <li>AI nudges for the agent ("Suggest asking about past medication," etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>5. Post-Session Automation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AI generates a session summary</li>
        <li>Stores data securely in a HIPAA-compliant database</li>
        <li>Feedback forms and follow-up scheduling</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        A leading online music education platform approached KubeAce with a critical challenge: their existing third-party video conferencing solution was inadequate for music instruction due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poor audio quality that distorted musical tones and instrument sounds</li>
        <li>Latency issues that made real-time instruction nearly impossible</li>
        <li>Lack of specialized features for music visualization and annotation</li>
        <li>Limited scalability during peak class times</li>
        <li>High licensing costs that threatened the company's unit economics</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        KubeAce designed and developed a custom WebRTC-based video conferencing platform specifically optimized for music education:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>High-fidelity Audio:</strong> Implemented specialized audio processing with configurable noise cancellation that preserved instrument tones while eliminating background noise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Low-latency Architecture:</strong> Built on LiveKit with a globally distributed server infrastructure to minimize latency between instructors and students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Music-specific Features:</strong> Developed custom components for sheet music sharing, notation overlay, virtual piano visualization, and real-time feedback tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recording & Playback:</strong> Created high-quality lesson recording with multi-track capabilities for separate audio channels (voice, instrument).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kubernetes Deployment:</strong> Implemented an auto-scaling Kubernetes infrastructure that efficiently handled varying loads throughout the day.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The custom video conferencing solution transformed the client's online music education experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio quality rated <strong>95% better</strong> than previous solution in blind tests</li>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        A growing e-commerce platform had initially built their backend on AWS Lambda but was facing significant challenges with their serverless architecture:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unpredictable and escalating costs during traffic spikes</li>
        <li>Cold start latency issues impacting customer experience</li>
        <li>Limitations in processing larger transactions due to Lambda timeout constraints</li>
        <li>Complex orchestration of numerous Lambda functions leading to maintenance difficulties</li>
        <li>Data transfer costs between Lambda functions and other AWS services</li>
        <li>Difficulty implementing certain architectural patterns within Lambda's constraints</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        KubeAce designed and executed a strategic migration from AWS Lambda to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Architecture Assessment:</strong> Mapped all Lambda functions and their interactions, identifying service boundaries and dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Containerization Strategy:</strong> Converted Lambda functions into containerized microservices, grouping related functions where appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GKE Infrastructure:</strong> Implemented a production-ready GKE environment with regional clusters, node auto-provisioning, and preemptible instances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Knative Implementation:</strong> Used Knative for serverless-like capabilities within Kubernetes, enabling scale-to-zero and request-based scaling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phased Migration:</strong> Executed a staged migration approach with parallel running systems and traffic shifting to minimize risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring & Optimization:</strong> Implemented comprehensive observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and Google Cloud Monitoring.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The migration delivered significant technical and business benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>47% reduction</strong> in monthly infrastructure costs</li>
        <li>Average API latency reduced by <strong>62%</strong>, eliminating cold start issues</li>
        <li><strong>Zero downtime</strong> achieved during the migration process</li>
        <li>Processing capacity increased by <strong>300%</strong> for complex transactions</li>
        <li>Development velocity improved with <strong>35% faster</strong> feature delivery</li>
        <li>Enhanced architectural flexibility enabled new capabilities that weren't possible with Lambda</li>
        <li>Simplified operational model with a unified Kubernetes platform</li>
      </ul>
      
      <blockquote>
        "Moving from Lambda to GKE was a strategic decision that transformed our business. KubeAce's methodical approach to the migration gave us confidence throughout the process, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We now have a platform that gives us both the elasticity we need and the cost control our business requires."
